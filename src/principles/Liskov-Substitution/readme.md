Suppose we’re building an Error handler for a particular web application and the requirements are to perform different types of actions based on the type of error. In this scenario, let’s just take 2 types of errors:

Database Error
Connection Error
Both of the above error classes extend an abstract class called CustomError

//Test
// Test 2
